# Portfolio

Hello World! I'm Helmy Hussain, a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Jyväskylä, specializing in Video Game Production. I'm currently in my final term and deeply passionate about software development and game programming. Currently seeking opportunities in programming roles, I've curated a [Portfolio](https://fl4tf33t.github.io/docs/index.html) to showcase my projects. Feel free to explore my [Scripts](https://github.com/Fl4tF33t/Fl4tF33t.github.io/tree/main/CodeSnippets) and get in touch with me at HelmyHelsinki@yahoo.com.
