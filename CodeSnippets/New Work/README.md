# Code / Scripts

These scripts are intentionally stripped down and modular — they represent the core building blocks I reuse across projects to get started quickly. Rather than a complete or rigid framework, this repository showcases small, composable systems and tools such as common programming patterns, a game state machine, utility components (like timers), and a flexible save system. Each piece is designed to be simple, extensible, and easy to adapt, providing a lightweight foundation that can grow alongside the needs of a project without imposing unnecessary structure early on.
