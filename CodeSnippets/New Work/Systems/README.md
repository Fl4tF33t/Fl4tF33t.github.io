# Systems

##### Save System

This folder contains a flexible save system I’ve developed, designed to handle serialization, persistence, and optional encryption. It serves as a reusable foundation for saving and loading game data across projects.



##### State Machine

This folder showcases a gameplay state machine used to manage game flow. It provides a clean, modular way to handle states like menus, gameplay, and pause, making it easier to structure and maintain game logic.



##### Tasks

This folder includes a rudimentary task system for player quests and objectives. It allows for defining, tracking, and completing tasks, providing a basic framework for quest management in games.


##### Composition

This folder contains a simple composition system that enables dynamic assembly of game objects from modular components. It promotes flexibility and reusability in game object design.

##### Pathfinding

This folder features a basic pathfinding implementation, allowing game entities to navigate through the environment. It provides foundational algorithms for movement and obstacle avoidance. Currently working on Flow Fields.
