# Systems

##### Save System

This folder contains a flexible save system I’ve developed, designed to handle serialization, persistence, and optional encryption. It serves as a reusable foundation for saving and loading game data across projects.



##### State Machine

This folder showcases a gameplay state machine used to manage game flow. It provides a clean, modular way to handle states like menus, gameplay, and pause, making it easier to structure and maintain game logic.
