# Basic AI LOGIC - With NavMeshAgent

These modular code snippets represent the initial steps in my journey of developing AI logic. Each piece of code is designed to be self-contained and reusable, serving as a building block for creating more complex AI behaviors. Through these snippets, I experimented with various algorithms and techniques, gradually honing my skills in crafting intelligent systems. While simple in nature, they laid the groundwork for more sophisticated AI implementations in my projects.
