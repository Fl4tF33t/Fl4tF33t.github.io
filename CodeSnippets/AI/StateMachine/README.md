# Finite-State-Machine (FNS)

This core logic package serves as a versatile foundation that can easily integrate into other projects. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, it provides a straightforward AI framework ideal for creating basic demos and prototypes. With its modular design and clear structure, developers can swiftly set up and customize AI behaviors, making it an invaluable resource for a wide range of applications and demonstrations. Unfortunately, there is no visual interface available for this system; it's purely code-based without an editor option.
