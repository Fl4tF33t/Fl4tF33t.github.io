# Workflow
My scriptable objects and custom editor scripts serve as invaluable tools for optimizing project workflows and enhancing customization. With scriptable objects, I create versatile data containers that can be seamlessly reused across various game elements, ensuring modularity and easy maintenance. Additionally, my custom editor scripts empower me with tailored tools to streamline workflows and elevate the user experience directly within the Unity Editor.
